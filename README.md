| **Attorney** | Liability exposure, documentation trail, privilege concerns |
| **Security** | Ports, services, CVEs, technical remediation |
| **Operations** | Change tickets, uptime risk, rollback steps |
| **Parent** | "Your kid's iPad" vs "Unknown device on kids' Wi-Fi" |

## Risk Classification

| Priority | Ports | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **P0 Critical** | 23, 445, 3389, 5900, 135, 139, 1080 | Remote access & file sharing — fix immediately |
| **P1 Admin** | 8080, 8443, 8888, 9000, 9090 | Admin panels — often unprotected |
| **P2 Watch** | 22, 80, 443 | Common services — note when NEW |

## Configuration

### Optional: Enable AI Summaries

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Anthropic (recommended)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-latest

# Or OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

Without API keys, the app uses intelligent rule-based summaries.

```bash
npm run dev       # Start dev server
npm run build     # Production build
npm run lint      # Run linter
